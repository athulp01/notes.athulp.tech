# Chapter 6: Link Layer and LANs
## Service Provided
1. Framing - Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer datagram within a link-layer
frame before transmission over the link.
2. Link access - A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by which a frame is
transmitted onto the link.
3. Reliable Delivery - When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service, it guarantees to
move each network-layer datagram across the link without error but,  many wired link-layer protocols do not provide a reliable delivery service.
4. Error detection and correction - Because there is no need to forward a
datagram that has an error, many link-layer protocols provide a mechanism to detect such bit errors.
